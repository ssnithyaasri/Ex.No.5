# EXP 5: COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF PROMPTING PATTERNS AND EXPLAIN WITH VARIOUS TEST SCENARIOS

# Aim: To test and compare how different pattern models respond to various prompts (broad or unstructured) versus basic prompts (clearer and more refined) across multiple scenarios.  Analyze the quality, accuracy, and depth of the generated responses 

### AI Tools Required: 

# Explanation: 
Define the Two Prompt Types:

Write a basic Prompt: Clear, detailed, and structured prompts that give specific instructions or context to guide the model.
Based on that pattern type refined the prompt and submit that with AI tool.
Get the ouput and write the report.

Prepare Multiple Test Scenarios:
Select various scenarios such as:
Generating a creative story.
Answering a factual question.
Summarizing an article or concept.
Providing advice or recommendations.
Or Any other test scenario
For each scenario, create both a naïve and a basic prompt. Ensure each pair of prompts targets the same task but with different levels of structure.
Run Experiments with ChatGPT:
Input the naïve prompt for each scenario and record the generated response.
Then input the corresponding basic prompt and capture that response.
Repeat this process for all selected scenarios to gather a full set of results.
Evaluate Responses : 
	Compare how ChatGPT performs when given naïve versus basic prompts and analyze the output based on Quality,Accuracy and Depth. Also analyse does ChatGPT consistently provide better results with basic prompts? Are there scenarios where naïve prompts work equally well?
Deliverables:
A table comparing ChatGPT's responses to naïve and basic prompts across all scenarios.
Analysis of how prompt clarity impacts the quality, accuracy, and depth of ChatGPT’s outputs.
Summary of findings with insights on how to structure prompts for optimal results when using ChatGPT.

# Aim
To test and compare how different prompt patterns (naïve vs. basic) affect ChatGPT’s responses across a range of tasks. The focus is on analyzing the quality, accuracy, and depth of the outputs.

# Prompt Types Defined
| Prompt Type      | Description                                                                               |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Naïve Prompt** | A vague, unstructured, or minimal prompt that lacks clarity and direction.                |
| **Basic Prompt** | A clear, structured, and specific prompt that provides context and detailed instructions. |

| ------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Creative Story**     | Tell me a story.          | Write a short story (150-200 words) about a robot who learns to paint in a futuristic city. Include a twist ending. |
| **2. Factual Question**   | What is AI?               | Explain what Artificial Intelligence is in simple terms, including examples and its applications in daily life.     |
| **3. Summarizing**        | Summarize climate change. | Summarize the concept of climate change in under 100 words, covering causes, effects, and solutions.                |
| **4. Providing Advice**   | I need advice.            | What advice would you give to a college student who wants to balance academics and part-time work effectively?      |
| **5. Explaining Concept** | Explain gravity.          | Explain the concept of gravity as if you're teaching a 10-year-old, using real-world analogies.                     |

# Analysis
Does ChatGPT consistently provide better results with basic prompts?
Yes. In all five scenarios, the responses to basic prompts were:

More accurate and factually correct

Deeper in content with more nuanced explanation or creativity

Better structured and aligned with the user's intent

Are there scenarios where naïve prompts work equally well?
➖ Slightly, in factual answers (like "What is AI?"), ChatGPT still generated reasonably accurate responses. However, depth and relevance improved significantly with basic prompts.

# Why Basic Prompts Perform Better:
They give the model a clear direction and context.

They reduce ambiguity and ensure better alignment with user intent.

They help generate responses that are more relevant, rich, and usable.

# Summary of Findings
Prompt structure directly impacts output quality.

Creative, summarization, and advisory tasks benefit the most from structured prompts.

Even for factual tasks, clarity improves usefulness and depth.

Naïve prompts tend to yield generic, shallow, or off-topic responses.

# Conclusion
Proper prompt engineering—crafting specific, detailed instructions—plays a crucial role in optimizing the quality of ChatGPT outputs. Users are encouraged to adopt basic prompting patterns to achieve richer, more relevant, and accurate results in any AI-assisted task.

# Result:
The prompt for the above-said problem executed successfully.
